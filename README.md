# babeldiff

`babeldiff` is a diff tool for reviewing changes that port C++ to Rust. It was
built for the Zircon kernel's in-place conversion, where each change replaces
a C++ implementation with Rust (called through FFI) that is meant to follow
the C++ line for line.

It parses both languages, pairs each removed C++ function with the Rust
function that replaces it, lines the two up side by side, and flags places
where the Rust does not do the same thing:

- **comments** that were lost, added, or reworded
- **error returns** that differ in code or order, and failures that one side
  handles and the other propagates
- **locks** taken in a different place or on a different lock
- **control flow** (`if`, loops, `switch`/`match`, `return`, `break`) with no
  counterpart
- **steps** (calls) that only one side performs

The output is plain text in the style of `diff -y`, meant to be read by people
and by agents, a self-contained HTML page, or JSON.

Its job is to help reviewers find real mistakes in a conversion, so it errs
toward precision: differences that are usually just translation (a renamed
operand, a reworded comment, a helper call spelled differently, a comment that
stays in the C++) are notes, and only differences a reviewer must check are
issues.

## Install

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

This builds a single static binary; tree-sitter grammars for C++ and Rust are
compiled in.

## Usage

```sh
# In a Fuchsia checkout: compare a commit with its parent, or a range.
babeldiff git HEAD
babeldiff git origin/main..my-branch

# A patch file (git format-patch, git show, or git diff output), or stdin.
babeldiff patch change.patch
git show HEAD | babeldiff patch

# With -C, patch mode reads full files from the repository by the blob ids in
# the patch, and can look up C++ that the change did not touch.
babeldiff patch -C ~/fuchsia --base origin/main change.patch

# Compare every function in a set of files.
babeldiff files handle_table.cc handle_table.rs
```

Useful options:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--format html -o report.html` | Write a self-contained HTML page for reviewing in a browser (see below). |
| `--layout stacked` | Print each C++ unit above the Rust it aligns with, untruncated. Better for agents and narrow terminals. |
| `--format json` | Machine-readable findings for agents (see below). |
| `--issues-only` | Leave out notes, and pairs with no issues. |
| `--summary` | Only the per-function summaries and findings. |
| `-U N`, `--context N` | Only rows within N rows of a difference. |
| `--width N` | Width of the side-by-side view (default `$COLUMNS` or 160). |
| `--pair Cpp=rust` | Force a pairing the matcher missed. Repeatable. |
| `--min-changed F` | Fraction of a function's lines a change must touch for it to be compared (default 0.25). |
| `--no-search` | Don't search the repository for unchanged C++. |

The exit status is 0 when there are no issues, 1 when there are, and 2 on
error, like `diff`.

Each pair has a header, the aligned source, a summary, and a findings list
with `file:line` references on both sides. The marker column is:

| Marker | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `=` | Aligned and equivalent. |
| `~` | Aligned, with a note: a difference that is often just translation (reworded comment, different helper calls). |
| `!` | Aligned, with an issue: different error code, lock, propagation, or success/failure. |
| `<` | Only in C++. |
| `>` | Only in Rust. |

Rust safety comments (`// SAFETY: ...` and `# Safety` doc sections) are
expected additions: they are shown, marked `>`, with no finding, and never
aligned with a C++ comment.

Locking is compared through ksync's differences from C++. `ksync::lock!(let g
= self.lock.lock())`, `self.read_lock()`, `self.write_lock()` and a
`#[guarded]` struct's `self.lock_mu()` count as taking the lock that C++'s
`Guard<...> guard{&lock_}` takes. Lock tokens are treated as bookkeeping and
shown with no finding: `let token = guard.token()`, a forged
`LockToken::new()` in an FFI shim whose C++ caller holds the lock, and binding
a guarded field with `self.field.get(token)`. A guarded field read through
its `KCell` (`self.flashes.get(&token)`) matches the C++ member (`flashes_`).
`guard_<lock>(&token)` and `fields_mut()` are field access, not acquisitions.
Clang thread-safety annotations (`TA_REQ`, `TA_GUARDED`) are ignored on the
C++ side, since in Rust they become token parameters.

Findings start with `!` (issue) or `~` (note), so `grep '^    !'` lists the
issues. The first lines of the report count issues by kind. At the end the
report lists functions it could not pair and the FFI shims it recognized,
including shims it could not resolve (`-> ambiguous: A or B`), which
`--pair` settles.

Each finding has a kind, which maps to the part of the porting rubric it
checks:

| Kind | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `comment` | A comment lost, added or reworded. Each lost comment is its own finding. |
| `error-path` | Error codes, propagation, and success versus failure. |
| `lock` | Locks taken or released. |
| `control-flow` | Branches, loops, returns, and tests added to or dropped from a condition. |
| `call` | Calls one side makes and the other doesn't. |
| `assert` | Assertions. A dropped assert is an issue. |
| `trace` | Trace and debug printing. A dropped trace is an issue. |
| `order` | The same step at a different position. |
| `atomic` | Memory ordering of atomic operations. A Rust ordering weaker than the C++ one (which is `seq_cst` when unstated) is an issue. |

`tests/fixtures/fifo/expected.txt` is a complete example; its Rust contains
four planted mistakes (a different error code, a rollback replaced by `?`, a
lock moved ahead of the argument checks, and a dropped comment).
`tests/fixtures/doorbell` is a class hierarchy folded into one Rust type with
an enum, with four more (a test added to a condition, a dropped trace, a
dropped comment in one override, and a different error code); babeldiff
reports exactly those four as issues.

## JSON output

`--format json` prints one object for agents and scripts. Each finding has a
stable id (`<C++ function>#<n>`), its severity, kind and rubric reference, the
message, and `path`, `line` and source `text` on each side. Each pair says how
it was found (`link`: `ffi`, `ffi-name`, `similarity` or `forced`), why
(`rationale`), and which C++ overrides it folds in. Unpaired functions, FFI
shims (with `ambiguous` candidates when babeldiff could not choose) and C++
helpers called from Rust are listed at the end. `version` is bumped only when
a field changes meaning.

```sh
babeldiff git HEAD --format json --issues-only > findings.json
```

## HTML report

`--format html` writes one self-contained HTML file, with no external scripts,
styles or fonts. You can mail it, attach it to a review, or open it from disk.

```sh
babeldiff git HEAD --format html -o review.html
```

The page is laid out so that a reviewer's attention goes to what differs:

- A sidebar lists every function pair with a red, amber or green dot and its
  issue and note counts, and tracks which pairs you have marked reviewed.
  That state is kept in your browser's local storage.
- Each pair opens with cards for the four checks (error returns in order,
  locks, control flow and comments). The cards that differ come first and are
  red. After them comes the list of findings, which link to their rows.
- The aligned code has C++ on the left and Rust on the right. Matching rows
  stay plain, notes get a faint amber tint, and issues are red with the
  message spelled out. Code on only one side is set against a hatched blank.
  Closing braces and other lines the alignment skips are dimmed.
- Hovering an identifier highlights it on both sides under either spelling
  (`subscriber_count_`, `subscriber_count`, `kMaxSubscribers` and
  `MAX_SUBSCRIBERS`), and error codes (`ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY` and
  `Status::NO_MEMORY`) highlight together.
- "Fold matching rows" collapses long runs of equivalent rows, and "Only
  functions with issues" hides the rest.
- Keyboard: `j`/`k` next and previous difference, `n`/`p` next and previous
  function, `x` mark reviewed, `f` fold, `i` issues only, `?` help.

The page follows the system's light or dark setting, stacks the two languages
on narrow screens, and prints cleanly.

## How it works

1. **Inputs.** The change is turned into the C++ files as they were before and
   the Rust files after, with the lines the change touched. In `git` mode
   files are read at both revisions; in `patch` mode they are rebuilt from the
   hunks (or read by blob id with `-C`).
2. **Units.** Each function is parsed with tree-sitter and flattened into
   units: comments, statements, and the headers of `if`/`else`/loops/`switch`/
   `match`/`case`, plus `return`/`break`/`continue`. Each unit gets
   language-neutral features: normalized calls and identifiers
   (`CommitRange` = `commit_range`, `lock_` = `self.lock`, `kFoo` = `FOO`),
   error codes (`ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY` = `Status::NO_MEMORY`), locks
   (`Guard<Mutex> guard{&lock_}` = `self.lock.lock()` = `ksync::lock!(...)`),
   whether it propagates an error, and comment words.
   Common idioms are normalized so they line up:
   `if (status != ZX_OK) return status;` reads as `?`, and so do a status
   chained through `if (status == ZX_OK) status = B();` to a final
   `return status;` and a status set in each branch and checked once;
   `if (!ac.check()) return ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY;` after an allocation reads as
   `try_new(..).ok_or(NO_MEMORY)?`;
   `return c ? A : B;` as `if c { A } else { B }`,
   `*out = x; return ZX_OK;` as `Ok(x)`, and `case A: case B:` as `A | B =>`.
   Declarations with no initializer, pure bindings such as
   `let state = self.state();`, out-parameter writes and thread-safety
   assertions are bookkeeping, not steps.
3. **Pairing.** C++ functions are paired with Rust functions by, in order:
   explicit `--pair`s; the FFI shim pattern (the new C++ body calls
   `rust_<class>_<method>`, whose `#[no_mangle]` definition forwards to the
   Rust method, or the shim's name spells the C++ function's); the same
   class and method name; then a score combining name similarity and body
   similarity, where comments count double. When a shim calls several
   same-named methods (`A::create` and `B::create`), the type path decides,
   and if nothing does the shim is reported as ambiguous rather than
   guessed. A `#[no_mangle]` function that does the work itself is the port,
   and a C++ one-line trampoline hands the shim to the C++ it calls.
   C++ overrides of a method in related classes (found from the class
   hierarchy) are folded into the one Rust function that replaced virtual
   dispatch with an enum and a `match`, and each override is aligned against
   the arm that carries it. Rust functions still unpaired are looked up in
   the repository (files named like the Rust file, then `git grep` for the
   CamelCase and snake_case names), so Rust that ports C++ the change did not
   delete is still compared, and C++ still unpaired is matched with an
   untouched Rust function of the same name. Doc comments on C++
   declarations in headers are attached to the definitions, since that is
   where Rust doc comments come from (an override without one takes its base
   class's). A comment that is still in the C++ after the change, in a
   changed file or word for word in one the change did not touch, is not
   reported as lost.
4. **Alignment.** Units are aligned with an order-preserving weighted LCS over
   unit similarity. Units left between two aligned rows are then lined up by
   position when each side has as many of a kind, so a renamed condition or
   a `case` turned `match` arm is one changed step. Aligned units are
   compared feature by feature, and `if` conditions test by test; unaligned
   ones are reported, and a unit that resembles one on the other side at a
   different position is reported as possibly reordered.

## Library

The crate is a library with a thin CLI on top:

```rust
use babeldiff::{analyze, input::ChangeSet, render};

let cs = ChangeSet::from_files(&[(cpp_path, cpp_text), (rust_path, rust_text)]);
let report = babeldiff::run(&cs, &analyze::Options::default(), &mut analyze::NoFinder);
for pair in &report.pairs {
    for finding in &pair.findings {
        println!("{:?} {}", finding.severity, finding.message);
    }
}
print!("{}", render::render(&report, &render::RenderOptions::default()));
let page = babeldiff::html::render_html(&report, &Default::default());
```

`babeldiff::git::Git` and `babeldiff::git::RepoFinder` provide the git
integration; implement `analyze::CppFinder` to look up C++ some other way.

## Limitations

- A C++ function split across several Rust functions (or the reverse) is
  paired with its best match only; the rest shows as unpaired.
- Macros are compared by name and the calls inside their arguments, not
  expanded.
- Similarity thresholds are tuned on about 55 Zircon conversion changes; use
  `--pair` when the matcher gets a pairing wrong.
- It compares functions. C++ that stays C++ but changes, FFI declarations,
  and class and field comments are not checked.

## Development

```sh
cargo test          # unit tests and golden tests over tests/fixtures
BLESS=1 cargo test  # rewrite expected outputs after an intentional change
```
